# Vim-Grand - a GRadle ANDroid plugin

This is a Vim plugin for Android development using Gradle as a build system. It is based on the excellent hsanson/vim-android plugin, except that it is be written mostly in python, is unit tested (when possible/sane), and is meant for gradle only.

Getting all paths for syntastic is in place, as well as generating the (exurbitant) tags file.
