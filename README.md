# Vim-Grand - a GRadle ANDroid plugin

WORK IN PROGRESS!

This is a Vim plugin for Android development using Gradle as a build system. It is based on the excellent hsanson/vim-android plugin, except that it is be written mostly in python, is unit tested (when possible/sane), and is meant for Gradle only.

It is still very much a work in progress, but the following is there:
- getting paths for Syntastic
- generating the (exurbitant) ctags file.
