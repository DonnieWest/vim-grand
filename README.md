# Vim Android Gradle

This is a Vim plugin for Android development using Gradle as a build system. It will be based on the excellent hsanson/vim-android plugin, except that it will be written mostly in python, is unit tested, and is meant fo gradle only.

There is not much here yet as it is very much a work in progress. Maybe the development branch already has something interesting.
